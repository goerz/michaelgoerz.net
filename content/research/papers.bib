    abstract ={
        Considering the unique energy level structure of the one-axis twisting
        Hamiltonian in combination with standard rotations, we propose the
        implementation of a rapid adiabatic passage scheme on the Dicke
        state basis. The method permits to drive Dicke states of the
        many-atom system into entangled states with maximum quantum Fisher
        information. The designed states allow to overcome the classical
        limit of phase sensitivity in quantum metrology and sensing. We
        show how to generate superpositions of Dicke states, which maximize
        metrological gain for a Ramsey interferometric measurement. The
        proposed scheme is remarkably robust to variations of the driving
        field and the number of atoms.

        Numerical simulations of the proposed system demonstrate TAI

        apply quantum optimal control to devise a methodology suitable to
        address this nonadiabaticity. Our studies are of interest for
        current efforts to realize compact and robust matter-wave rotation
        sensors, as well as in fundamental-physics applications of TAI.

        separation of 20ℏk and map out the expected signal contrast depending
        on the variance of the initial velocity distribution and the value of

       that combines existing gradient-based methods of quantum optimal control
       with automatic differentiation. The approach allows to optimize
       practically any computable functional and is implemented in two open
       source Julia packages, GRAPE.jl and Krotov.jl, part of the
       QuantumControl.jl framework. Our method is based on formally
       rewriting the optimization functional in terms of propagated states,
       overlaps with target states, or quantum gates. An analytical application
       of the chain rule then allows to separate the time propagation and
       the evaluation of the functional when calculating the gradient. The
       former can be evaluated with great efficiency via a modified GRAPE
       scheme. The latter is evaluated with automatic differentiation, but
       with a profoundly reduced complexity compared to the time
       propagation. Thus, our approach eliminates the prohibitive memory
       and runtime overhead normally associated with automatic
       differentiation and facilitates further advancement in quantum
       control by enabling the direct optimization of non-analytic
       functionals for quantum information and quantum metrology,
       especially in open quantum systems. We illustrate and benchmark the use
       of semi-automatic differentiation for the optimization of perfectly
       entangling quantum gates on superconducting qubits coupled via a
       shared transmission line. This includes the first direct

       interferometer (TAI) based on three-dimensional confinement and

       and wave-packet dispersion, enables arbitrary holding times, and
       facilitates control to create complex trajectories that allow for
       optimization to cancel unwanted sensitivity, fast splitting and
       recombination, and suppression of detrimental nonadiabatic
       excitation. Thus, the design allows for further advancement of
       compact, high-sensitivity, quantum sensing technology. In
       particular, we focus on the implementation of quantum-enhanced
       accelerometers and gyroscopes. We discuss TAI protocols for both
       spin-dependent and scalar trapping potentials. Using optimal control
       theory, we demonstrate the splitting of the wave function on a time
       scale two orders of magnitude shorter than the previous proposal
       using adiabatic dynamics, thus maximizing the time spent at full
       separation, where the interferometric phase is accumulated. The

        how robust the population dynamics are with respect to variations

        relative to the rest frame.  We then show that using rapid

        a functional that can be used for an ensemble optimization over the

                    information science depends on the proper mathematical expression of the
                    physical target. Here we demonstrate the power of optimization
                    functionals targeting an arbitrary perfect two-qubit entangler,
                    creating a maximally-entangled state out of some initial product state.
                    For two quantum information platforms of current interest, nitrogen
                    vacancy centers in diamond and superconducting Josephson junctions,
                    we show that an arbitrary perfect entangler can be reached faster and
                    with higher fidelity than specific two-qubit gates or local
                    equivalence classes of two-qubit gates. Our results are obtained with
                    two independent optimization approaches, underlining the crucial role
                    of the optimization target.}

                    neutral atoms by making use of the Rydberg blockade. Achieving the ultra-high
                    fidelities required for quantum computation with such Rydberg gates is however
                    compromised by experimental inaccuracies in pulse amplitudes and timings, as
                    well as by stray fields that cause fluctuations of the Rydberg levels. We
                    report here a comparative study of analytic and numerical pulse sequences for
                    the Rydberg CPHASE gate that specifically examines the robustness of the gate
                    fidelity with respect to such experimental perturbations. Analytical pulse
                    sequences of both simultaneous and stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP)
                    are found to be at best moderately robust under these perturbations. In
                    contrast, optimal control theory is seen to allow generation of numerical
                    pulses that are inherently robust within a predefined tolerance window. The
                    resulting numerical pulse shapes display simple modulation patterns and their
                    spectra contain only one additional frequency beyond the basic resonant Rydberg
                    gate frequencies. Pulses of such low complexity should be experimentally
                    feasible, allowing gate fidelities of order 99.90 - 99.99\% to be achievable
                    under realistic experimental conditions.},

                    use, namely gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE) and Krotov's
                    method. Both approaches are derived from the variational principle
                    but differ in the way the control is updated, additional costs are
                    accounted for, and second order derivative information can be
                    included. We find that GRAPE produces smoother control fields and
                    works in a black-box manner, whereas Krotov with a suitably chosen

                    of two properly chosen states is sufficient to distinguish any two
