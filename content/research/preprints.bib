%    abstract ={
%        Considering the unique energy level structure of the one-axis twisting
%        Hamiltonian in combination with standard rotations, we propose the
%        implementation of a rapid adiabatic passage scheme on the Dicke
%        state basis. The method permits to drive Dicke states of the
%        many-atom system into entangled states with maximum quantum Fisher
%        information. The designed states allow to overcome the classical
%        limit of phase sensitivity in quantum metrology and sensing. We
%        show how to generate superpositions of Dicke states, which maximize
%        metrological gain for a Ramsey interferometric measurement. The
%        proposed scheme is remarkably robust to variations of the driving
%        field and the number of atoms.
