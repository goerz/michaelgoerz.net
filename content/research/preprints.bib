    abstract = {We investigate a possible realization of an ultracold-atom
        rotation sensor that is based on recently proposed tractor atom
        interferometry (TAI). An experimental design that includes
        generation of a Laguerre-Gaussian-beam-based "pinwheel" optical
        lattice and multi-loop interferometric cycles is discussed.
        Numerical simulations of the proposed system demonstrate TAI
        rotation sensitivity comparable to that of contemporary matter-wave
        interferometers. We analyze a regime of TAI rotation sensors in
        which nonadiabatic effects may hinder the system's performance. We
        apply quantum optimal control to devise a methodology suitable to
        address this nonadiabaticity. Our studies are of interest for
        current efforts to realize compact and robust matter-wave rotation
        sensors, as well as in fundamental-physics applications of TAI.
