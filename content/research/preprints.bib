   abstract = {The robustness of an atomic fountain interferometer with respect to
        variations in the initial velocity of the atoms and deviations from the
        optimal pulse amplitude is examined. We numerically simulate the
        dynamics of an interferometer in momentum space with a maximum
        separation of 20‚Ñèk and map out the expected signal contrast depending
        on the variance of the initial velocity distribution and the value of
        the laser field amplitude. We show that an excitation scheme based on
        rapid adiabatic passage significantly enhances the expected signal
        contrast compared to the commonly used scheme consisting of a series of
        Rabi pulses. We demonstrate further substantial increase of the
        robustness by using optimal control theory to identify splitting and
        swapping pulses that perform well on an ensemble average of pulse
        amplitudes and velocities. Our results demonstrate the ability of
        optimal control to significantly enhance future implementations of
        atomic fountain interferometry.
