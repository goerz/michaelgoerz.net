    abstract = {We investigate a possible realization of an ultracold-atom
        rotation sensor that is based on recently proposed tractor atom
        interferometry (TAI). An experimental design that includes
        generation of a Laguerre-Gaussian-beam-based "pinwheel" optical
        lattice and multi-loop interferometric cycles is discussed.
        Numerical simulations of the proposed system demonstrate TAI
        rotation sensitivity comparable to that of contemporary matter-wave
        interferometers. We analyze a regime of TAI rotation sensors in
        which nonadiabatic effects may hinder the system's performance. We
        apply quantum optimal control to devise a methodology suitable to
        address this nonadiabaticity. Our studies are of interest for
        current efforts to realize compact and robust matter-wave rotation
        sensors, as well as in fundamental-physics applications of TAI.

    abstract ={
        Considering the unique energy level structure of the one-axis twisting
        Hamiltonian in combination with standard rotations, we propose the
        implementation of a rapid adiabatic passage scheme on the Dicke
        state basis. The method permits to drive Dicke states of the
        many-atom system into entangled states with maximum quantum Fisher
        information. The designed states allow to overcome the classical
        limit of phase sensitivity in quantum metrology and sensing. We
        show how to generate superpositions of Dicke states, which maximize
        metrological gain for a Ramsey interferometric measurement. The
        proposed scheme is remarkably robust to variations of the driving
        field and the number of atoms.
