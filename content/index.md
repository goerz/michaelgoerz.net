# Research

I am a  postdoctoral fellow at the U.S. Army Research Lab in Adelphi, MD.

My research broadly addresses the tools, methods, and applications of quantum technology from a theoretical and numerical perspective.  Currently, I am working on applications of machine learning to quantum control, and on the design of robust quantum sensing devices.

Previously, I was a postdoc with [Hideo Mabuchi](https://mabuchilab.org) at Stanford, working on optimal control of quantum networks, after completing my PhD in the group [Christiane Koch](https://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/en/einrichtungen/ag/ag-koch/index.html)</a>, working on optimal control of quantum gates in open quantum systems.
