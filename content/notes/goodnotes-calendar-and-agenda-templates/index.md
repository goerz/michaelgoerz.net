# Goodnotes Calendar and Agenda Templates

The following are some Moleskine-inspired templates that I used in [Goodnotes](http://www.goodnotesapp.com).
They use letter-sized paper, which works well in full screen on a 12.9 inch iPad.

These templates use the [Rotis Semi Serif (55 Roman)](https://www.linotype.com/49242/rotis-semi-serif-family.html) and [Rotis Semi Sans (55 Regular)](https://www.linotype.com/49198/rotis-semi-sans-family.html) fonts.

* Cover ([pdf](classic_notebook_cover_letter.pdf), [zipped Affinity Designer file](classic_notebook_cover_letter.afdesign.zip))
* Yearly calendar ([2018 pdf](calendar2018.pdf), [2019 pdf](calendar2019.pdf), [Python script](https://gist.github.com/goerz/d0e1a28be8f322bf7bad3e9b8672bc67))
* Weekly agenda ([pdf](week_agenda_letter.pdf), [zipped Affinity Designer file](week_agenda_letter.afdesign.zip))

While the cover and weekly agenda are created manually in [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/), the yearly calendar is created through a Python script for each year, through [lualatex](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TeX_Live) and [tikz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ)
