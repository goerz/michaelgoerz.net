# OCT Diagrams in TikZ

I decided to make my first really complex TikZ drawing: A diagram explaining
the implementation of an Optimal Control Theory algorithm I did recently. There
is a print version:

* [oct_diagram.pdf](oct_diagram.pdf) ([TeX](oct_diagram.tex))
* [oct_diagram.tikz](oct_diagram.tikz)

In addition to that, there are some animated presentation slides, explaining
three variations of the algorithm:

* [oct_slides.pdf](oct_slides.pdf) ([TeX](oct_slides.tex))
* [oct_storeall.tikz](oct_storeall.tikz)
* [oct_storenone.tikz](oct_storenone.tikz)
* [oct_segments.tikz](oct_segments.tikz)

The process of creating these diagrams was fairly involved, but not more than I
would have expected. I don't think any other tool would have been up to the
task, and the result is quite exhilarating. The principles of TeX/TikZ make it
quite easy to create variations of existing pictures.
