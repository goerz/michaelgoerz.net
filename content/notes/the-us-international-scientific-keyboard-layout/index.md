# The "U.S. International - Scientific" Keyboard Layout

I routinely find myself having to type a lot unicode symbols on US keyboards on macOS, both for accented characters in European languages (umlauts) and for various "math". There is a ["U.S. International - PC" keyboard layout](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/120938/wheres-the-us-international-keyboard-on-os-x-10-9-mavericks) that purports to provide accented characters, but I find it to be a bit cumbersome for the accents I type most frequently (German umlauts). Moreover, it does not address the need for "scientific" unicode symbols.

In my default text editor, [vim](https://neovim.io), I have both the option to use [digraphs](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/digraph.html) and the  [`julia-vim` plugin](https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/julia-vim) to conveniently type out the [extensive unicode symbols](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/unicode-input/) used in the [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org) language. The latter is in fact my *preferred* way to type unicode, even beyond Julia. I've gone so far as to have a [KeyboardMaestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) macro that copies the text of a web form, pastes it into a temporary file that it opens in vim, waits for vim to quit, and pastes the content of the file back into the web form.

Still, there are lots of situations were round-tripping through vim is inconvenient, and it would be nice to be able to type unicode *directly*. Instant messaging (Slack/Discord) is a typical situation where I often want to type "unicode-math". Thus, using [Ukelele][], I created a keyboard layout "U.S. International - Scientific for macOS. The default keys are the standard US layout:

Unicode symbols are accessed through the alt ("option") key ⌥:

The following is a complete list of all the supported characters. It obviously skews to my personal use case of most frequently used symbols, and thus heavily favors symbols occurring in quantum physics.

The keys with a dark-gray background are "dead" keys that wait for the next key press, effectively entering a different keyboard mode:

* ![key "acute"](us_scientific_acute_key.png) — type a letter with "acute" accent
* ![key "grave"](us_scientific_grave_key.png) — type a letter with "grave" accent
* ![key "greek"](us_scientific_greek_key.png) — type a Greek (or Hebrew) letter
* ![key "subscript"](us_scientific_subscript_key.png) — type a subscript
* ![key "superscript"](us_scientific_superscript_key.png) — type a superscript
* ![key "slash"](us_scientific_slash_key.png) — type a letter with a slash-through
* ![key "mathscript"](us_scientific_mathscript_key.png) — type a letter from the "Script" mathematical alphabet
* ![key "mathbold"](us_scientific_mathbold_key.png) — type a letter from the "Bold" mathematical alphabet
* ![key "doublestruck"](us_scientific_doublestruck_key.png) — type a letter from the "Double-struck" mathematical alphabet

All of these "modes" will be detailed below



## Accented characters

There's two categories of keys resulting in accented characters. Unicode has ["combining diacritical marks"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combining_Diacritical_Marks) that apply an accent to the previous keys. This is particularly useful for "math accents" such as dots, tilde, or hats, since these can be combined with *any* previous character. We have the following combining accents mapped directly to keys.

* over-bar, mapped to `⌥5`
* over-arrow (vector), mapped to `⌥l`
* over-dot (time derivative), mapped to `⌥;`
* over-double-dot (second time derivative), mapped to `⌥⇧;`
* over-tilde, mapped to ``⌥⇧` ``
* over-hat, mapped to `⌥⇧6`

For a few other accents that are primarily used for names in European languages, but not as match accents, we use dead keys (where the key indicating the mark is pressed *first*):

*   "acute" accent, by pressing ![key "acute"](us_scientific_acute_key.png)

    [![Keyboard layout "acute"](us_scientific_acute.png)](us_scientific_acute.png)

*   "grave" accent, by pressing ![key "grave"](us_scientific_grave_key.png)

    [![Keyboard layout "grave"](us_scientific_grave.png)](us_scientific_grave.png)

*   "slash-through", by pressing ![key "slash"](us_scientific_slash_key.png)

    [![Keyboard layout "slash"](us_scientific_slash.png)](us_scientific_slash.png)

This is in addition to some very commonly used accented characters like umlauts that are accessible *directly*.

## Sub- and Superscripts

*   Subscript, by pressing ![key "subscript"](us_scientific_subscript_key.png)

    [![Keyboard layout "subscript"](us_scientific_subscript.png)](us_scientific_subscript.png)

*   Superscripts, by pressing ![key "superscript"](us_scientific_superscript_key.png)

    [![Keyboard layout "superscript"](us_scientific_superscript.png)](us_scientific_superscript.png)


[Unfortunately](https://twitter.com/fairbanksjp/status/1401281556451192834), the unicode standard  does not provide a full alphabet of super-/sub-scripts. Hopefully, this will [change](https://github.com/stevengj/subsuper-proposal) at some point in the future.


## Greek characters

*   Greek letters can be accessed by by pressing ![key "greek"](us_scientific_greek_key.png)

    [![Keyboard layout "greek"](us_scientific_greek.png)](us_scientific_greek.png)

* This includes the first few letters of the Hebrew alphabet, which are sometimes used in mathematics

* Note that there is epsilon (`ϵ`) and var-epsilon (`ε`), as well as phi (`ϕ`) and var-phi (`φ`). These are sometimes use with different meanings in math. Whether it is a good idea to mix them in the same text/code would be a matter of debate.

* The alternative end-of-word sigma (`ς`), isn't very commonly used in science, but if you ever find yourself having to type actual ancient Greek, it might come in handy.

## Mathematical alphanumeric symbols

The unicode standard defines [several alternative styles for math alphabets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Alphanumeric_Symbols). A few of them are supported via dead keys.

*   Double-struck letters, by pressing ![key "doublestruck"](us_scientific_doublestruck_key.png). I use these somewhat frequently to denote standard number sets (`ℂ`), or the identity operator (`𝟙`)


    [![Keyboard layout "doublestruck"](us_scientific_doublestruck.png)](us_scientific_doublestruck.png)

*   Bold letters, by pressing ![key "mathbold"](us_scientific_mathbold_key.png). I use these sometimes to denote vectors. For *classical vectors*, I usually prefer `v⃗`, but I might write e.g. `𝐉̂` for an angular-momentum operator.

    [![Keyboard layout "mathbold"](us_scientific_mathbold.png)](us_scientific_mathbold.png)

*   Script letters, by pressing ![key "mathscript"](us_scientific_mathscript_key.png). I sometimes use these for operators in Liouville space.

## Installation

You can install the keyboard layout by downloading

[USScientific.bundle.zip](USScientific.bundle.zip)

and placing the resulting `bundle` file either in `/Library/Keyboard Layouts`
(system-wide installation) or `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts` (user installation).
You can also open the bundle in [Ukelele][]  and use the "Install" option from
the "File" menu (and of course adapt the layout for your needs).

After installation, the layout should be available in the Keyboard System
Preferences, in "Input Sources", as "U.S. International - Scientific".

The layout is also available on [Github](https://github.com/goerz/USScientific.bundle).

Bonus tip: for figuring out what exactly a given unicode character is in the
keyboard layout, type it out in Vim with the [characterize vim plugin](https://github.com/tpope/vim-characterize)
installed, put the cursor on top of it, and us the `ga` command.
