This repository contains the source files and code to generate the website <https://michaelgoerz.net>


## Getting Started

Run `make preview` to generate the website locally and run a local web server on port 8000 to view it at <http://localhost:8000>.

This will watch all files for changes and re-generate them if necessary. This does not extend to *new* files that were generated since the server started running.

Run just `make` to see more options.
